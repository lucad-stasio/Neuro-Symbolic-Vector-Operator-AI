# Neuro-Symbolic-Vector-Operator-AI

This repository contains the code, data, and research for a conceptual framework designed to bridge the gap between statistical Large Language Models (LLMs) and human-like symbolic reasoning.

# **Abstract**
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive fluency in natural language tasks, yet
their dependence on statistical pattern-matching constrains their ability to perform struc-
tured reasoning and reduces interpretability. This paper introduces a conceptual neuro-
symbolic architecture inspired by the principles of human symbolic cognition. The frame-
work integrates three primary modules. First, a sentence transformer encodes natural lan-
guage into high-dimensional symbolic vectors. Second, a Logical Operator module—trained
via few-shot prompting with human-annotated data—classifies relationships between sym-
bols using a defined set of twelve operators grounded in linguistic theory. Finally, an Explorer
model interprets these symbolic vectors and operators, representing logical relationships as
linear transformations within the vector space. By modeling reasoning as a sequence of
operator-driven transformations, the architecture aims to enable artificial systems not only
to process text but to generate coherent “idea flows” that approximate human-like conceptual
reasoning. We argue that such an approach has the potential to advance both the reasoning
capacity and creative flexibility of AI systems, marking a step toward architectures that
more closely reflect the inner dynamics of the human mind. Future directions include un-
supervised discovery of novel operators and mechanisms for symbolic “neuroplasticity” in
vector-space organization.

# **Repository Contents**
This repository is an active research project and currently contains the following:


`notebooks`: Cosine_Similarity_Demo.ipynb: A Google Colab notebook demonstrating the core "Symbolizer" concept. It shows how to convert sentences into symbolic vectors and measure their semantic similarity.

`data`: annotated_sentences_v1.csv: The initial, human-annotated dataset of sentence pairs and their corresponding relational operators.

`paper`: Contains the LaTeX source files for the full research paper, "The Emergence of a Symbolic AI."

# **How to Use**
To explore the core concept, you can run the demonstration notebook:

Open the Cosine_Similarity_Demo.ipynb file.

Click the "Open in Colab" badge at the top.

Run the cells sequentially to see the sentence-to-symbol conversion and analysis in action.

Project Status
This is an ongoing independent research project. The current focus is on expanding the human-annotated dataset and training the first version of the operator classification model.
